When I ask about complex problems involving:
- Algorithm optimization
- Deep architectural decisions  
- Mathematical calculations
- Performance bottlenecks I've been stuck on

Suggest using extended thinking mode before proceeding.

For routine tasks (CSS, debugging, refactoring, component creation), use regular reasoning.
